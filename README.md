## 🖼️ Image Optimization & Build Process

This template includes **automated image optimization** to ensure fast loading and best practices:

### 🔧 Scripts included

| Script | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts dev server |
| `npm run build` | Builds production bundle |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint |
| `npm run preview` | Previews production build locally |

### 📦 `prebuild` script (runs before `build`)

Before every build, the template:

1. **Optimizes all images** in `public/img/` → outputs WebP, JPEG, and PNG to `public/img/optimized/`

2. **Generates a fully SEO-optimized `index.html`** with dynamic meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD

> ✅ No manual image conversion needed. Just drop your `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp` files in `public/img/` and run `npm run build`.

### 📁 Image workflow

```bash
# 1. Add your original image
public/img/avatar.jpg

# 2. Run build (or prebuild)
npm run build

# 3. Optimized versions are auto-generated
public/img/optimized/avatar.webp
public/img/optimized/avatar.jpg
public/img/optimized/avatar.png  # (if source is PNG)
```

> 📌 The portfolio uses WebP by default for best compression and quality.
